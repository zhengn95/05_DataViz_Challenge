# 05_DataViz_Challenge
Challenge 5 for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this assignment, we use Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to visualize and analyze data

### Scenario: 
Pymaceuticals, Inc. is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

This analysis uses complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

In this analysis, I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study and a summary of the study results.
