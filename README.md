# 05_DataViz_Challenge
Challenge 5 for UC Berkeley Data Analytics Bootcamp. In this assignment, we use Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to visualize and analyze data

### Scenario: 
Pymaceuticals, Inc. is a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

This analysis uses complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

In this analysis, I was tasked with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study and a summary of the study results.

### Mean Tumor Volume and Standard Deviation
According to the Summary Statistics, the mean Tumor Volume and median Tumor Volume at all time points for the Capomulin-treated mice (mean = 40.7 mm3, median = 41.6 mm3) were the smallest compared to all other drug regimens except for Ramicane-treated mice (mean = 40.2 mm3, median = 40.7 mm3). Likewise, the Ramicane-treated mice had the lowest variability in tumor volume (var = 23.5 mm3, standard deviation = 4.8 mm3) followed by the Capomulin-treated mice (var = 24.9 mm3, standard deviation = 5.0 mm3). 

### Bar Chart: Drug Regimen versus Number of Observed Mice/Timepoint 
The drug regimen with the highest number of observed mice per timepoint was Capomulin followed closely by Ramicane.

### Pie Plot: Sex of Mice
There were more male mice (958 mice, 51%) versus female mice (922 mice, 49%) in the study.
